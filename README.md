# Abstract
This paper introduces a computational framework for simulating the movement of multiple swimmers with various geometries immersed in a Navier-Stokes fluid. 
The approach relies on the finite element method with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework to handle swimmer displacements. 
Numerous numerical experiments demonstrate the adaptability of the computational framework across various scenarios.
All the implementations are made using the Feel++ finite element library.
